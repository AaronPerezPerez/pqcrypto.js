This is the version 2.0 of the "new" McBits software. Three implementations are 
included in this version, namely

- m12_t62_simple,
- m13_t128_sse, and
- m13_t128_avx.

The parameters m (for field size 2^m) and t (for the degree of the Goppa 
polynomial) are indicated by the names of the implementations. The code length n 
is assumed to be 2^m.

m12_t62_simple serves as a simple C implementation that hopefully helps users
understand how the new McBits software works. m13_t128_sse is optimized for the 
Intel Sandy Bridge/Ivy Bridge microarchitectures, while m13_t128_avx is 
optimized for the Haswell microarchitecture.

The implementations are in the form such that they can be put directly into 
SUPERCOP (https://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html) for benchmarking. The 
implementations also make use functions (e.g. randombytes()) and some symmetric 
primitives in SUPERCOP.

# kyber

## Overview

The [Kyber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyber_cryptosystem) post-quantum asymmetric
cypher compiled to WebAssembly using [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).
A simple JavaScript wrapper is provided to make Kyber easy to use in web applications.

The parameters are configured to slightly above 128-bit strength.

The underlying cypher implementation in use is [McBits](https://tungchou.github.io/mcbits).

## Example Usage

	(async () => {
		const keyPair /*: {privateKey: Uint8Array; publicKey: Uint8Array} */ =
			await kyber.keyPair()
		;

		const plaintext /*: Uint8Array */ =
			new Uint8Array([104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 0]) // "hello"
		;

		const encrypted /*: Uint8Array */ =
			await kyber.encrypt(plaintext, keyPair.publicKey)
		;

		const decrypted /*: Uint8Array */ =
			await kyber.decrypt(encrypted, keyPair.privateKey) // same as plaintext
		;

		console.log(keyPair);
		console.log(plaintext);
		console.log(encrypted);
		console.log(decrypted);
	})();

Note: Kyber is a low-level cryptographic primitive, not a high-level construct like libsodium's
[crypto_box](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption.html).
This module can be combined with a symmetric cypher and a MAC to provide such a construct, but you
should avoid using kyber directly for anything important if you lack the experience to do so.

## Changelog

Breaking changes in major versions:

4.0.0:

* Cyphertext generated by kyber 4.x is incompatible with that of kyber 3.x, and vice versa:

  - Upgraded to McBits 2.0 and switched symmetric cypher from Salsa20 to ChaCha20.

  - Fixed a bug that sometimes caused invalid output.

  - Decreased maximum plaintext size from 403 to 106 (for consistency with ntru, as well as
    smaller output).

3.0.0:

* As part of upgrading from asm.js to WebAssembly (with asm.js included as a fallback),
the API is fully asynchronous.

2.0.0:

* Switched to McBits from [HyMES](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/CBCrypto/index.php?pg=hymes).

* Removed some undocumented functions as part of minor API cleanup.
